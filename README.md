# Scraping_Seamless

## Introduction
My second project at NYC Data Science Academy. The code in this repository scrapes data for approximately 1500 restaurants that deliver to East Village, Manhattan from Seamless.com. An analysis is conducted to determine whether restaurant ratings significantly differ by cuisine type, and how order quality, timeliness, and accuracy are correlated with ratings.

## Creation
This code was written by Aron Berke to be used for non-commercial (academic in nature) purposes.

## Layout
The seamless_selenium_scraper file contians code to retrieve the relevant urls from Seamless search results, and then scrape those urls for the appropriate data. The ratings_analysis file contains code to conduct the analysis required to answer the project's central questions.

## Final Output
Please feel free to email me if you'd like to view a copy of the presentation associated with this project.
